We will need - Candidates.count - candidates-where-stage-was-or-is-interview (count) - hires (count)
suggestion - add a field in candidates - interviewed - boolean in candidiates. When a candidiate stage is changed to interview, the flag turns True. This way we can get interviews.count from the same table.
